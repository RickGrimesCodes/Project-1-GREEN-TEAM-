# Project 1 GREEN TEAM! 

### Hello UNCC Data Analyst Bootcamp Graders and Instructiors, this is the our 1st project!
### This readme should hopefully explain the choices of datasets, questions, and code we used.

## The dataset we chose 

We initially started off with picking a dataset, we chose a 2022 Heart Study, this dataset was already realitvley clean.
We each ended up having to filter out other data to answer questions we had

## Splitting the workload and Questions we asked

We decided to split the workload, by having each of us answer questions we had for this paticular dataset.
those of us with less work to do on the 'working directly with data' part focused on other things, such as the README,
and presentation.

* What is the relationship between ‘lifestyle’ indicators and heart disease? -- This was answered by Summer

* How prevalent is heart disease in male vs female? -- This was answered by Suno

* Which locations have the highest/lowest incidence of heart disease? -- This was answered by Dylan

* Is Covid-19 connected to heart disease? What are the effects? -- This was answered by Nolan

Additionally, Nolan worked on the README and Suno worked on the Powerpoint presentation.
